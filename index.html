			<p class="mini-header">About Me</p>
			<p class="about-me">Hi. I am 24 years old and moving to Rhode Island after living in San Diego, CA my entire life. I went to community college after not getting accepted to anything local to San Diego. Did my general ed classes and an intro to java. Decided to do a coding bootcamp and loved it. During and after the bootcamp I was still taking courses to transfer to SDSU for Computer Science	 and towards the end had about 90 units. I was able to get two different amazing jobs because of the coding bootcamp but struggled because of my mental health issues and tons of anxiety. Then the pandemic hit, made everything worse and really knocked me down. Joined multiverse in 2021 and I now have a position at Citizens. I am easy going, friendly, like playdoe I'm non-toxic, and super understanding.</p>

						Mentor<br>Taught coding and chess to students in an after school program.<br>
						Using scratch.mit, introduced them to the basics of programming with a mix of CTTF's curriculum as well as some of my own 'challenges' or projects to spark some ideas. <br>Always excited to support their learning and amazed at their creativity, projects and ideas. Before this position I had no intention of becoming a teacher, but now it is something I want to pursue in the future because we need more diversity in tech.
